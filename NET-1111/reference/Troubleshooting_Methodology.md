| **Step**                                    | **Description**                                                          | **Example**                                                           |

| **1. Identify the Problem**                 | Gather information, ask questions, determine what is or isn’t working.   | A user reports they can’t access the internet.                        |
| **2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause** | Consider the most likely reasons for the issue. Start with the simplest. | Could be a loose cable, wrong IP settings, or ISP outage.             |
| **3. Test the Theory**                      | Verify your theory by testing or troubleshooting step.                   | Ping the default gateway. If successful, ISP may be the problem.      |
| **4. Establish a Plan of Action**           | Decide on steps to resolve the issue and minimize impact.                | If the NIC driver is faulty, plan to reinstall it.                    |
| **5. Implement the Solution**               | Put the fix into place carefully.                                        | Replace a bad Ethernet cable or restart a switch.                     |
| **6. Verify Full System Functionality**     | Test to ensure the solution worked and nothing else is broken.           | Confirm the user can browse the web and print to the network printer. |
| **7. Document Findings & Actions**          | Record the problem, cause, and solution for future reference.            | Log ticket: "User unable to connect – faulty cable replaced."         |
