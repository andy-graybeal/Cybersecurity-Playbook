| **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)** | Networking approach where the control plane is separated from the data plane            | Makes networks more flexible, programmable, and automated | Cisco DNA Center, OpenFlow               |
| **Control Plane**                     | Decides how packets should be forwarded (logic/brains)                                  | In SDN, this moves to a central controller                | Routing tables, policy decisions         |
| **Data Plane**                        | Actually forwards packets (action/hands)                                                | Still lives on network devices (switches, routers)        | ASICs in switches, forwarding engines    |
| **Management Plane**                  | Interface used to configure and monitor devices                                         | SDN simplifies this through centralized tools             | CLI, SNMP, APIs, Cisco DNA Center        |
| **SDN Controller**                    | Centralized software brain that manages flow rules and policies                         | Simplifies operations and enforces policy consistently    | Cisco DNA Center, OpenDaylight, ONOS     |
| **Southbound APIs**                   | Communication from controller → network devices                                         | Tells devices how to forward traffic                      | **OpenFlow**, NETCONF                    |
| **Northbound APIs**                   | Communication from controller → applications / business logic                           | Lets apps request network behavior                        | REST APIs, automation tools              |
| **Policy-Based Networking**           | Admins set intent (e.g., “HR VLAN can’t access Finance VLAN”) instead of manual configs | Intent-based networking is CCST-level buzzword            | Cisco DNA Center, ACI policies           |
| **Programmability**                   | Ability to use code/scripts to control network                                          | Reduces repetitive manual config                          | Python scripts, Ansible                  |
| **Automation**                        | Automatic provisioning/configuration of devices                                         | Faster, reduces errors                                    | Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), Cisco DNA |
| **Centralized Management**            | One place to configure, monitor, and secure the network                                 | Replaces device-by-device config                          | Cisco DNA Center dashboards              |
| **Virtualization**                    | Abstracts network functions from hardware                                               | Supports cloud/virtual networks                           | NFV (Network Function Virtualization)    |
| **Benefits of SDN**                   | Agility, centralized control, automation, reduced human error                           | What exam wants you to recognize                          | Faster troubleshooting, scalability      |
