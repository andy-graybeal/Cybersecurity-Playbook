| **HTTPS**     | TCP 443                          | Application  | Secure version of HTTP. Uses **TLS/SSL** to encrypt communications (protects login details, banking, etc.).                                            |
| **FTP**       | TCP 20 (data), 21 (control)      | Application  | Transfers files between client and server. Can use **active or passive mode**. Not encrypted by default.                                               |
| **SMTP**      | TCP 25                           | Application  | Sends email between clients and mail servers (or between servers). Used only for outgoing mail.                                                        |
| **POP3**      | TCP 110                          | Application  | Downloads email from a server to a client. Simple, but usually **deletes messages** after download.                                                    |
| **IMAP**      | TCP 143                          | Application  | Retrieves emails from server, but keeps them stored there. Allows synchronization across devices.                                                      |
| **DNS**       | UDP/TCP 53                       | Application  | Translates **domain names** (e.g., `google.com`) into **IP addresses**. Uses UDP for queries, TCP for zone transfers.                                  |
| **DHCP**      | UDP 67 (server), 68 (client)     | Application  | Automatically assigns **IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers** to clients. Uses DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge). |
| **SNMP**      | UDP 161 (queries), 162 (traps)   | Application  | Manages network devices (routers, switches, servers). SNMP manager collects info from SNMP agents on devices.                                          |
| **Telnet**    | TCP 23                           | Application  | Provides remote CLI (command-line interface) access to devices. Sends data in **plaintext** (insecure).                                                |
| **SSH**       | TCP 22                           | Application  | Secure alternative to Telnet. Provides encrypted remote CLI access. Used heavily in network administration.                                            |
| **TLS/SSL**   | Uses app ports (e.g., HTTPS 443) | Presentation | Provides **encryption, authentication, and integrity** for data. SSL is legacy; TLS is modern.                                                         |
| **NetBIOS**   | TCP/UDP 137–139                  | Session      | Legacy Windows protocol for file and printer sharing over LANs.                                                                                        |
| **SMB**       | TCP 445                          | Session      | Modern Windows file/printer sharing (successor to NetBIOS). Allows network drives and shared folders.                                                  |
| **PPTP**      | TCP 1723                         | Session      | Early VPN tunneling protocol (now considered insecure). Encapsulates PPP packets inside IP.                                                            |
