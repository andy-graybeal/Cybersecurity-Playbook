| **Technology** | **Full Name**                                | **What It Does**                                                                                                       | **IPv4 Equivalent / Difference**                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ND**         | Neighbor Discovery                           | Handles address resolution (like ARP in IPv4), router discovery, prefix discovery, and neighbor reachability.          | Replaces ARP, ICMP Router Discovery, some DHCP functions.           |
| **SLAAC**      | Stateless Address Autoconfiguration          | Allows a host to automatically configure its own IPv6 address from router advertisements (RA).                         | No direct IPv4 equivalent â€” in IPv4, usually manual config or DHCP. |
| **MLD**        | Multicast Listener Discovery                 | Manages multicast group memberships (lets routers know which nodes want specific multicast traffic).                   | Equivalent to IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) in IPv4.    |
| **RA / RS**    | Router Advertisement & Router Solicitation   | Part of ND. RS (from host) asks for network info; RA (from router) provides prefixes, gateway, and autoconfig details. | In IPv4, DHCP or static settings are used.                          |
| **DHCPv6**     | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 | Provides stateful configuration (more control, like assigning DNS servers, etc.).                                      | Similar to DHCP in IPv4, but works with SLAAC or on its own.        |
