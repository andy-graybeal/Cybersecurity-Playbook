## CCST Quick Notes

-   **MIMO** = multiple streams to one device\
-   **MU-MIMO** = multiple streams to many devices\
-   **OFDMA** = multiple users share one channel efficiently\
-   **Advanced MIMO** = future Wi-Fi 7 upgrade with lots more streams

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Memory Tip

-   **MIMO = One device, more lanes**\
-   **MU-MIMO = Many devices, more lanes**\
-   **OFDMA = Slice the channel like a pizza**\
-   **Advanced MIMO = Superhighway (Wi-Fi 7)**
