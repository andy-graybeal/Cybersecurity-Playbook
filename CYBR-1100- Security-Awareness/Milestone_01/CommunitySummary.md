# Service Learning Project: Community Partner Profile

## 🏫 Organization
**Hocking College Classmates**  
Type: Community group (student peers in the Cybersecurity & Network Systems program)  

## 🔒 Why Security Awareness Matters
Security awareness is important to my classmates because:  
- As future cybersecurity professionals, they need to build strong habits early.  
- Students are frequent targets for phishing, account compromise, and social engineering.  
- Protecting personal devices and online accounts ensures academic integrity and protects sensitive college data.  
- Building awareness now prepares them for internships, certifications, and entry-level IT/security roles.  

## 🛠️ Tailoring Training Materials
To meet their needs, I will:  
- Focus on **student-relevant threats** (passwords, passkeys, passphrases, MFA and password managers).  
- Create **clear, visually engaging materials** like posters, slides, and infographics.  
- Include **interactive elements** (creating strong yet memorable passwords).  
- Align lessons with **real certification topics** (Security+, CCST, and CCNA Security concepts).
