| Topic                          | What it means (A+ level)                                                                                 | Recognize / keywords                               | Quick example                                                           |

| **What is a container?**       | Lightweight way to run an app with its dependencies, isolated from the host OS and other apps.           | Isolation, namespaces, cgroups                     | Running a web app in its own container so library versions don’t clash. |
| **Containers vs. VMs**         | Containers share the host kernel (no full guest OS); VMs include a full OS per guest.                    | Faster start, smaller footprint vs VM              | A container starts in seconds; a VM takes a minute+ to boot.            |
| **Images & layers**            | An image is a read-only blueprint (layered). Containers are runtime instances of images.                 | Image, layer cache, tag (e.g., `:latest`)          | Pull `nginx:alpine`; run a container from it.                           |
| **Dockerfile / build**         | A small text file that defines how to build an image.                                                    | `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `EXPOSE`, `CMD`             | Build a custom image with your app and required packages.               |
| **Registries**                 | Servers that store/share images. Public or private.                                                      | Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR/ACR/GCR                      | `docker pull python:3.12` from Docker Hub.                              |
| **Runtime/engine**             | Software that runs containers.                                                                           | Docker Engine, containerd, Podman                  | Start/stop containers via Docker Desktop (lab use).                     |
| **Networking basics**          | Default “bridge” network isolates containers; publish ports to the host.                                 | Bridge, host, overlay; port mapping                | Run a container and map `8080:80` to reach it in a browser.             |
| **Storage**                    | Containers are ephemeral; use volumes/bind mounts for persistent data.                                   | Volume, bind mount                                 | Mount a volume for a database container so data survives restarts.      |
| **Orchestration (high level)** | Tools to run many containers reliably across multiple hosts.                                             | Kubernetes (K8s), Swarm, pods, services            | A small web app scaled to 3 replicas behind a service/load balancer.    |
| **Security basics**            | Minimize privileges; scan images; keep secrets out of images.                                            | Least privilege, rootless, image scanning, secrets | Use a non-root user in the image; store API keys as secrets.            |
| **Platform notes**             | Works on Linux, macOS, Windows (often via WSL2 for Windows).                                             | WSL2, Windows containers                           | Run Docker Desktop on Windows using WSL2 backend.                       |
| **Updates & patching**         | Rebuild images with updated packages; pull newer base images.                                            | Immutable image, rebuild, retag                    | Rebuild an app image after a critical OpenSSL patch.                    |
| **Troubleshooting basics**     | Check logs, process list, and configuration.                                                             | `logs`, `ps`, `exec -it`, `inspect`                | `docker logs <name>` to diagnose a failing container.                   |
| **When to use containers**     | Great for stateless apps, microservices, dev/test labs. Use VMs for full OS isolation or heavy GUI apps. | “Scale out” friendly, quick start                  | Spin up an isolated lab stack (DB + web + cache) in minutes.            |
