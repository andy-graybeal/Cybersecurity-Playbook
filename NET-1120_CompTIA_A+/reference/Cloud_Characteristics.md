| Cloud characteristic (NIST)         | Plain meaning                                                                     | A+ angle / what to recognize                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Quick example(s)                                                                                            |

| **On-demand self-service**          | You can provision resources yourself without opening a ticket.                    | Techs spin up VMs, storage, or services from a portal/CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Create a VM from a template in minutes.                                                                     |
| **Broad network access**            | Services are reachable over the network via standard methods (web, API, mobile).  | Access SaaS/VMs from many device types and locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Use a browser/app to reach a cloud app anywhere.                                                            |
| **Resource pooling (multitenancy)** | Provider pools compute/storage/network for many customers with logical isolation. | Shared hosts; tenants are separated by virtualization and policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Multiple tenants on the same physical cluster.                                                              |
| **Rapid elasticity / scalability**  | Capacity expands/contracts quickly to match demand.                               | Know how scaling works and when to use each approach: <br>• **Horizontal scaling (scale out/in):** Add or remove **instances/nodes** behind a load balancer. Great for web/app tiers. <br>• **Vertical scaling (scale up/down):** Increase or decrease **resources of a single instance** (CPU/RAM/IOPS). Quick but limited by hardware. | Auto-scaling adds two more app servers at lunch; later scales back. Upgrading a VM from 2 vCPUs to 8 vCPUs. |
| **Measured service (metering)**     | Usage is monitored and billed per use.                                            | Watch costs tied to instance-hours, storage GB, egress bandwidth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Pay only for the time a VM runs and data you store/transfer.                                                |
