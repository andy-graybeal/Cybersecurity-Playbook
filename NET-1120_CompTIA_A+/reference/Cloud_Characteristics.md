| Characteristic (NIST)               | Plain meaning                                                             | A+ angle / what to recognize                                                    | Quick example                                                                |

| **On-demand self-service**          | Users can spin up resources without human interaction from the provider.  | Know that techs can provision VMs/storage from a portal/CLI.                    | Create a VM in minutes from a cloud dashboard. ([NIST Publications][1])      |
| **Broad network access**            | Services are reachable over networks via standard mechanisms (web, APIs). | Expect clients/agents, portals, and mobile access.                              | Sign in to a SaaS app from any device. ([NIST Publications][1])              |
| **Resource pooling (multitenancy)** | Provider serves many customers using pooled compute/storage/network.      | Shared infrastructure; isolation is logical, not physical.                      | Multiple tenants on the same physical hosts. ([NIST Publications][1])        |
| **Rapid elasticity / scalability**  | Capacity can expand/contract quickly to match demand.                     | Recognize **scale out/in** vs **scale up/down**; ties to cost and availability. | Add instances at lunch rush; remove them overnight. ([NIST Publications][1]) |
| **Measured service (metering)**     | Usage is monitored, controlled, and billed per use.                       | Watch egress, instance-hours, storage GB as cost drivers.                       | Pay only for the hours your VM runs. ([NIST Publications][1])                |
