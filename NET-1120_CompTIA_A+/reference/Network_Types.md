| **Satellite**                                  | Satellite dish (line of sight to provider) | 15–250 Mbps (higher latency)                             | Works anywhere with clear sky; latency \~600+ ms               |
| **Cellular (3G/4G/5G)**                        | Cellular towers (wireless)                 | 3G: \~1 Mbps, 4G/LTE: 10–100 Mbps, 5G: 300 Mbps–1 Gbps+  | Mobility advantage; dependent on coverage                      |
| **Dial-up**                                    | Telephone line with modem                  | Up to 56 Kbps                                            | Obsolete but still testable; very slow                         |
