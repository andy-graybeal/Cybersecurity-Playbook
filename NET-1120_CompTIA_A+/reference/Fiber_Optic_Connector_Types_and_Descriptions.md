| **ST**        | Straight Tip                            | Usually PC (Physical Contact) | Bayonet-style (push and twist, like BNC)                | Legacy networks, multimode fiber            | One of the oldest; bulky, not common today.                         |
| **SC**        | Subscriber Connector / Square Connector | PC/UPC or APC                 | Push-pull, square body                                  | Telecom, cable TV, data centers             | Simple, reliable, widely used; bigger than LC.                      |
| **LC**        | Lucent Connector                        | PC/UPC or APC                 | Small form-factor, push-pull                            | Modern switches, routers, SFP transceivers  | Very common today; half the size of SC, often used in data centers. |
| **FC**        | Ferrule Connector                       | PC/UPC or APC                 | Screw-on (threaded)                                     | Test equipment, single-mode applications    | Provides secure connection; mostly replaced by LC/SC in networking. |
| **MTP / MPO** | Multi-fiber Push-On                     | Usually PC/UPC                | Push-pull, rectangular, multi-fiber (12, 24, 48 fibers) | High-density backbone cabling, data centers | Supports parallel optics, very high bandwidth.                      |
| **E2000**     | –                                       | APC (angled)                  | Push-pull with spring-loaded cover                      | High-performance telecom                    | Less common, but great performance; expensive.                      |
| **DIN**       | Deutsches Institut für Normung          | PC/UPC                        | Round, screw-on                                         | Telecom, industrial networks                | Rare today, mostly legacy.                                          |
