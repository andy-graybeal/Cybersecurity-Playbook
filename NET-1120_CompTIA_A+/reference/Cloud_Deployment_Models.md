| **Public cloud**    | Third-party provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) in provider data centers             | Shared (multi-tenant) infrastructure, pay-as-you-go, very scalable    | Startups, bursty workloads, labs, SaaS apps                    | Spin up an EC2/Azure VM from a portal; use S3/Blob for storage      |
| **Private cloud**   | Single organization (on-prem or hosted)                                     | Dedicated resources, more control/customization, higher cost/overhead | Regulated environments, strict data residency, custom security | VMware/Hyper-V cluster in a company DC; OpenStack private cloud     |
| **Hybrid cloud**    | Mix of private + public with connectivity (VPN/Direct Connect/ExpressRoute) | Workloads/data can move or stretch between environments               | “Cloud bursting,” DR/backup to cloud, gradual migrations       | Keep databases on-prem; burst web tier to public cloud on peak days |
| **Community cloud** | Shared by organizations with a common mission/compliance need               | Governance and costs shared among similar orgs; specialized policies  | Healthcare groups, universities, government agencies           | Education consortium cloud; sector-specific hosted platforms        |
