| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)**              | Uses liquid crystals + backlight (CCFL or LED)        | Thin, lightweight, sharp images, low power         | Limited viewing angles, backlight bleed              | Monitors, laptops, TVs                  |
| **LED (Light Emitting Diode, a type of LCD)** | LCD panel with LED backlight (edge-lit or direct-lit) | Better brightness, contrast, thinner than CCFL LCD | Still limited by LCDâ€™s viewing angles                | Modern monitors, TVs                    |
| **OLED (Organic LED)**                        | Each pixel emits its own light (no backlight)         | Deep blacks, vibrant color, thin/flexible panels   | Expensive, shorter lifespan (burn-in risk)           | Phones, high-end TVs, VR                |
| **Plasma (legacy)**                           | Ionized gas cells emit light                          | Great color, contrast, wide viewing angles         | Heavy, high power use, image burn-in                 | Older HDTVs (phased out)                |
| **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube, legacy)**            | Electron beam strikes phosphors on glass tube         | Excellent color, contrast, multiple resolutions    | Bulky, heavy, high power                             | Old monitors, TVs                       |
| **Projector (LCD/DLP/LCoS)**                  | Projects image onto screen via lamp/laser/LED         | Large screen sizes, portable                       | Requires dark room, lamps wear out, lower resolution | Classrooms, presentations, home theater |
| **Touchscreen (capacitive/resistive)**        | Detects input from finger/stylus                      | Intuitive, combined input + display                | Can scratch, resistive less accurate                 | Phones, tablets, kiosks, POS systems    |
| **AR/VR Displays**                            | High-density LCD/OLED microdisplays, lenses           | Immersive experience, wide field of view           | Expensive, motion sickness issues                    | Gaming, simulations, training           |
