# Malware Detection Techniques

1. Indicators of Attack (IoA) - Identify that an attack is currently underway
    - Account Lockout - an inaccessible account through a normal login attempt has been taken over by an attacker
	- Concurrent Session usage - An attacker and legit user logged in at the same time
	- Blocked content - Data that is no longer available
	- Impossible travel - Access to resources that are otherwise impossible due to physical location
	- Resource consumption - Sudden depletion of resources: memory, cpu, space, network
	- Resource inaccessibility - Blocked resources that should otherwise be available
	- Out-of-cycle logging - Logs that don't correspond to actual events
	- Published/Documented - Documentation from external sources to help identify attacks
	- Missing logs - Deleted log files
2. Anti-Virus
    - Static Analysis - Signature-based monitoring; scanning files for known virus patterns
    - Dynamic Analysis - Heuristic monitoring; variety of techniques used to identify characteristics of a virus 
3. Monitoring and Response systems
    - HIDS - Host Intrusion Detection systems
	   - Runs on endpoint
	   - Automated Detection - saves time sorting through logs for indications
	- HIPS - Host Intrusion Prevention System
	   - Monitors like HIDS, but hopes to stop attempts by following specific rules
	- EDR - Endpoint Detection more and Response
	   - HIDS and HIPS rolled in one 
	   - Aggregates data from multiple endpoints into a centralized db
	   - Performs more sophisticated analytics that identify patterns and detect anomolies
