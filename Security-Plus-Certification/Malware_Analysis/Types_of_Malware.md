# Malware groups and the types of malware:

1.	Kidnap
		- Ransomware - Malicious software deisgned to extort money from victims in exchange for their endpoints to be restored to a normal working state
			- Blocking Ransomware - Prevents or blocks the user from using their computer in a normal fashion - an early mode of ransomware
			- Locking Ransomeware - Encrypts some or all the files on the device so that they cannot be opened, the device remains functional so that the ransom can be more easily paid.  The threat actors steal the data and threaten to release the data to the highest bidder/public if they don't pay the ransom
2.	Eavesdrop
		- Keylogger - a keylogger silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user thypes on the computer's keyboard.  the threat actor can then search the captured text for any userful information such as passwords, credit cards, or personal information.  it can be a software program or a hardware device
		- Spyware - spyware is tracking software deployed without consent or control of the user.  
			- Automatica download software - could install unathorized applications
			- Passive tracking technologies - could collect private information such as websites a user has visited
			- System-modifying software - modifies or changes user configuration, such as the web browser home page or search page, default media player or lower-level system functions
			- Tracking software - could collect personal information that can be shared widely or stolen, resulting in fraud or identity theft
3.	Masquerade
		- Trojan - an executable program that masquerades as performing a benign activity but also does something malicious.
		- Remote Access Trojan (RAT) - Gives remote access to the victim's computer, allowing unrestricted access
4.	Launch
		- Virus -  
			- File-based Virus - infects files when launched and spreads when the infected file is shared with another person
				- Commonly infected files include: 
					- docx/xlsx	
					- exe
					- msp
					- scr
					- cpl
					- msc
					- wsf
					- ps1
			- Fileless Virus - does not infect files, but native services and processes - these services used have been called "living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins)
				- Common LOLBins include:
				- Powershell
				- WMI
				- .NET 
				- Macros
				
		- Worm - uses a computer network to replicate; Actions worms have performed include deleting files, or allowing remote access
		- Bloatware - Software that is installed on a device without the user requesting it, which itself might not be harmful, but could contain malware or become a platform for other maleware to exploit if it contains a vulnerability
		- Bot - allows the infected computer to be placed under remote control of an attacker for the purpose of launching attacks.  Hundreds of thousands of computers can be infected with a bot, called a botnet and control by a "bot herder" to carry out distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks.
5.	Sidestep
		- Logic bomb - code added to a legitimate program but lies dormant, undetected, until a specific logical event triggers it - many logic bombs have been planted by disgruntled employees
		- Rootkit - can hide its presence and the presence of other malware by accessing lower layers of the OS or even using undocumented functions to make alterations
		- Backdoor - gives access to a computer, program or service that circumvents any normal security protections
