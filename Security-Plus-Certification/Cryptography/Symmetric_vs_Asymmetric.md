# Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptographhic algorithms

## Overview

Symmetry means the having the same parts on either side; and asymmetry means having different parts on either side of something.   
In cryptography, Symmetric algorithms use ths same key to encrypt or decrypt data and asymmetric algorithms use two different keys.  

It comes down to key sharing or not sharing on the what applications each is good at.   

Symmetrical cryptography is good for Hash Algorithms, SSL, and SSH.  Asymmetrical cryptography is good for sharing data with others.  

Asymmetrical cryptography outputs two keys.  One key is private and the other is public.  The public key you can share with everyone.
