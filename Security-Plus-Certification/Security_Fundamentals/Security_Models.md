# Security Concepts and Frameworks 


## Security Concepts

These concepts are considered the foundation to Cybersecurity

### Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA)

 - Confidentiality:  Ensures that only authorized parties can view the information
 - Integrity: Ensures that the information is correct and no unauthorized person or malicious software has altered the data
 - Availibility: Ensures that the data is accessible to only authorized users and not to unapproved individuals
 
### AAA

- Authentication - accepts a persons credentials
- Authorization - grants them access
- Accounting - makes record of resources accessed


## Security Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Frameworks

#### Framework Core - Defines activities needed to attain different cybersecurity results
Elements of the Framework Core
1. Function - The most basic information security tasks - Identify, protect, detect, respond, recover.
2. Category - Tasks to be carried out for each of the five functions
3. Subcategory - Tasks or challenges associated with each category
4. Information Sources - Documents or manuals that detail specific tasks for users and explain how to accomplish those tasks


#### Implementation Tiers
NIST Framework consists of four tiers.  The higher the tier, the more compliant the company is.

#### Profiles
A profile relates to both the status of the organization and it's roadmap towards compliancy.  These profiles allow an organization to see it's vulnerabilities at each step.


### Other Frameworks include:  
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Center for Internet Security (CIS), and Cloud Security Alliance.
