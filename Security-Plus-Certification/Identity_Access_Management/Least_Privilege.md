# Least Privilege and Access Control Schemes

Least privilege is granting access that is limited to what is only necessary for a user to complete their work

## Access Control Schemes

### DAC - Discretionary Access Control
The least restrictive scheme.  In DAC every object has an owner who has total control over that object.  The owner has the discretion (the choice) as to who can access their object and can grant permissions to other objects over these objects.  This scheme is used on major OS's.
The problem with this is embedded in the whole scheme itself. it relies on the user to set the proper level of security.  This could result in incorrect permission settings.  As well as permissions will be "inherited" by programs and act as an attack vector.

### MAC - Mandatory Access Control



### RBAC - Role-Based Access Control

### RB-RBAC - Rule-Based Role Based Access Control 

### ABAC - Attribute-Based Access Control
