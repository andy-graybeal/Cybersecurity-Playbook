| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Port Scan**             | Identifies open, closed, or filtered ports on a target system.                   | Maps attack surface; detects unnecessary services.    | Can be noisy, easily detected by IDS/IPS.                |
| **Network Scan**          | Discovers live hosts and devices on a network.                                   | Useful for asset inventory and visibility.            | May be blocked by firewalls.                             |
| **Vulnerability Scan**    | Automated check for known vulnerabilities (CVEs, misconfigurations, weak creds). | Fast, repeatable; aligns with compliance checks.      | High false positives; requires validation.               |
| **Credentialed Scan**     | Uses valid login credentials to test from an insider perspective.                | Deeper insight, detects misconfigurations accurately. | Needs privileged access; risk of exposure if creds leak. |
| **Non-Credentialed Scan** | External perspective without logins.                                             | Simulates outsider attacker; fast setup.              | Limited visibility; may miss internal flaws.             |
| **Active Scan**           | Direct interaction with targets (sending traffic/probes).                        | Provides real-time, detailed results.                 | Disruptive, higher chance of detection.                  |
| **Passive Scan**          | Monitors traffic without direct interaction.                                     | Stealthy; avoids disruption.                          | Less detail; only finds observable traffic issues.       |
| **Discovery Scan**        | Light touch, quick sweep to identify hosts/services.                             | Fast, low impact; good first step.                    | Not comprehensive; misses deeper issues.                 |
| **Compliance Scan**       | Checks systems against regulatory/industry standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.).     | Ensures regulatory alignment; structured reporting.   | Limited to predefined policy checks.                     |
