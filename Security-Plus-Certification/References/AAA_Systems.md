| AAA System                                                          | Purpose                                                                      | Key Features / Notes                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)**             | Centralized authentication for network access (VPNs, Wi-Fi, switches, etc.). | Uses UDP (ports 1812 for auth, 1813 for accounting); combines authentication and authorization in one step; encrypts only the password in access requests; widely used for wireless and remote access. |
| **TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)** | Authentication and authorization for admin access to network devices.        | Uses TCP (port 49); Cisco proprietary but widely supported; encrypts the entire packet (more secure than RADIUS); separates authentication, authorization, and accounting for fine-grained control.    |
| **Kerberos**                                                        | Authentication in Active Directory environments.                             | Uses tickets issued by a Key Distribution Center (KDC); prevents replay attacks with time-stamped tickets; default in Windows domains.                                                                 |
| **Diameter**                                                        | Next-gen RADIUS replacement (not as common).                                 | Uses TCP or SCTP; more reliable and secure than RADIUS; backwards-compatible; supports modern needs like VoIP and mobile.                                                                              |
| **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**                    | Accessing and managing directory services (like Active Directory).           | Used for authentication and authorization queries; commonly paired with Kerberos in AD; runs on TCP/UDP port 389 (LDAP) or 636 (LDAPS for secure).                                                     |
