| **Preventive**   | Stops incidents before they happen (firewalls, MFA, security guards).                        |
| **Detective**    | Identifies and alerts on incidents in progress or after they occur (IDS, SIEM, logs, CCTV).  |
| **Corrective**   | Fixes issues after detection (patching, restoring backups, reconfiguring systems).           |
| **Deterrent**    | Discourages attacks (warning banners, fences, lighting, visible cameras).                    |
| **Compensating** | Alternate control when primary cannot be implemented (using tokens when MFA is unavailable). |
