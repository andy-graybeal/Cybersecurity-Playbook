| **X.509 Certificate**                          | Standard format for digital certificates.   | Contains subject info, public key, issuer, validity, etc.                     | Basis for TLS/SSL, PKI.                          | Memorize fields: Subject, Issuer, Validity, Public Key, Extensions.   |
| **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**            | Framework for managing keys & certificates. | Uses CAs, RAs, and certificate policies.                                      | Enables trust and authentication across systems. | Security+ often asks about the **roles**: CA vs RA vs CRL/OCSP.       |
| **CA (Certificate Authority)**                 | Trusted entity that issues digital certs.   | Signs with private key; provides chain of trust.                              | Root of trust in PKI.                            | Root CA vs Intermediate CA difference is testable.                    |
| **RA (Registration Authority)**                | Subordinate to CA; validates requests.      | Verifies identities before cert issuance.                                     | Adds assurance before certificate generation.    | May appear in scenarios like “Who verifies the requestor’s identity?” |
| **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)**          | Request sent to CA to obtain a cert.        | Includes public key & identifying info.                                       | Start of certificate lifecycle.                  | Often generated on the server requesting TLS cert.                    |
| **CRL (Certificate Revocation List)**          | List of revoked certs published by CA.      | Distributed periodically.                                                     | Allows systems to reject compromised certs.      | Weakness = not real-time.                                             |
| **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)**  | Real-time certificate validation.           | Client queries OCSP responder to check status.                                | Faster than CRL, near-instant revocation check.  | Preferred over CRLs in modern systems.                                |
| **Wildcard Certificate**                       | Covers multiple subdomains.                 | \*.example.com → [www.example.com](http://www.example.com), mail.example.com. | Simplifies management, reduces costs.            | Only covers **one level** of subdomains.                              |
| **SAN (Subject Alternative Name) Certificate** | Supports multiple domain names.             | Example: example.com, example.org, mail.example.net.                          | Flexible option for multi-domain sites.          | SAN ≠ wildcard, exam likes to test this.                              |
| **Self-Signed Certificate**                    | Certificate signed by its own private key.  | No CA involvement.                                                            | Useful for internal testing, not public trust.   | Browsers flag as untrusted.                                           |
| **Root Certificate**                           | Highest trust anchor in PKI chain.          | Self-signed by CA.                                                            | Used to validate intermediate + leaf certs.      | Compromise = total PKI trust failure.                                 |
| **Intermediate Certificate**                   | Bridge between root and leaf.               | Signed by root, issues end-user certs.                                        | Provides layered trust, reduces root exposure.   | Common in web PKI.                                                    |
| **Code-Signing Certificate**                   | Signs executables/scripts.                  | Developer signs code; user verifies signature.                                | Prevents tampered/malicious code.                | Seen in software authenticity questions.                              |
| **Email (S/MIME) Certificate**                 | Provides email encryption & signing.        | Uses X.509 certs in email clients.                                            | Ensures confidentiality & authenticity.          | Important in **S/MIME vs PGP** comparisons.                           |
| **Machine / Device Certificates**              | Certs installed on devices.                 | Proves device identity on network.                                            | Used in 802.1X, VPNs, IoT security.              | Exam may tie this to **EAP-TLS**.                                     |
