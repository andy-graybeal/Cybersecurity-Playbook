| **SPF**        | Sender Policy Framework                                         | Prevents spoofing by verifying which mail servers are authorized to send on behalf of a domain.    | Domain owner publishes DNS TXT record with allowed IPs/servers. Receiving mail server checks sending IP against record. | Helps stop forged “From” addresses.                                 | Doesn’t verify message integrity; can be bypassed if not combined with DKIM/DMARC. |
| **DKIM**       | DomainKeys Identified Mail                                      | Ensures email content hasn’t been altered and verifies sender’s domain.                            | Sending mail server adds a cryptographic signature (private key). Receiving server checks it using public key in DNS.   | Confirms authenticity and integrity of email.                       | Only verifies domain, not individual sender identity.                              |
| **DMARC**      | Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance | Aligns SPF & DKIM results; tells receiving server how to handle failed checks.                     | Domain owner publishes a DNS TXT record with policy: *none, quarantine, reject*.                                        | Strengthens email trust; prevents delivery of unauthenticated mail. | Requires SPF and/or DKIM to be in place. Adoption is still uneven.                 |
| **ARC**        | Authenticated Received Chain                                    | Preserves authentication results across intermediaries (e.g., forwarding services, mailing lists). | Adds headers that record original authentication results, even if modified during forwarding.                           | Helps forwarded mail maintain trustworthiness.                      | Newer tech; not all providers support it yet.                                      |
| **MTA-STS**    | Mail Transfer Agent – Strict Transport Security                 | Enforces TLS encryption between mail servers.                                                      | Domain publishes DNS TXT + HTTPS policy. Sending MTA checks policy and enforces TLS.                                    | Protects email in transit from downgrade/MITM attacks.              | Optional; requires both sides to support it.                                       |
| **TLS-RPT**    | SMTP TLS Reporting                                              | Provides reports on email transport security issues.                                               | Domain publishes DNS TXT record with reporting address. Receivers send feedback if TLS fails.                           | Visibility into failed encryption attempts.                         | Reporting only — does not enforce protection.                                      |
