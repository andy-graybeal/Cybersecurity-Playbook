| **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**                  | Symmetric                            | Standard for encrypting data at rest and in transit; used in WPA2/WPA3, VPNs, file encryption.                |
| **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**                      | Symmetric                            | Legacy encryption, largely replaced due to weak key size (56-bit).                                            |
| **3DES (Triple DES)**                                   | Symmetric                            | Legacy improvement over DES by applying encryption 3 times; used in older systems, phased out.                |
| **Blowfish**                                            | Symmetric                            | General-purpose encryption; replaced DES in some apps; good for fast block encryption.                        |
| **Twofish**                                             | Symmetric                            | Successor to Blowfish; used in file and disk encryption (e.g., TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt).                         |
| **RC4**                                                 | Symmetric (stream cipher)            | Formerly used in SSL/TLS and WEP; considered insecure and deprecated.                                         |
| **RC5 / RC6**                                           | Symmetric                            | General data encryption, academic/legacy interest.                                                            |
| **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**                         | Asymmetric                           | Used for key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data (e.g., SSL/TLS certificates). |
| **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**                   | Asymmetric                           | Strong encryption with smaller keys; used in mobile devices, digital signatures, modern TLS.                  |
| **Diffie–Hellman (DH)**                                 | Asymmetric (key exchange protocol)   | Securely exchanges symmetric keys over an insecure channel (e.g., VPNs).                                      |
| **Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH)**                | Asymmetric (key exchange)            | More efficient key exchange for mobile/IoT devices.                                                           |
| **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**                   | Asymmetric                           | Used for digital signatures and authentication.                                                               |

| **PGP / GPG (Pretty Good Privacy / GNU Privacy Guard)** | Hybrid (uses symmetric + asymmetric) | Encrypting email and files; digital signatures.                                                               |
